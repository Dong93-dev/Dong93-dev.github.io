            "I am a graduate software developer with various skills. In the past
            six years, I immersed myself in academic engineering research. After
            achieving my PhD degree, I became more confident in handling various
            challenges and learning new skills quickly. I have learned to solve
            problems by developing software solutions through two interfaces I
            made for research group members. I used to work in an
            inter-disciplinary team, which developed my ability in talking ideas to different people and becoming a better
            team player. However, I decided to pursue my career in software
            engineering after finding a huge passion for coding. I enjoy
            developing reliable solutions to realistic problems together with
            team members, watching the solution value delivered step by step and
            seeing the real impact in its implementation.""

          <p> This full stack project produced a Reddit-like website where you can read articles, leave your comments, vote what you like and etc.. The whole project was designed in MVC pattern. The fully-tested backend was developed mainly using node.js, jest, express and knex, which provided a set of RESTful APIs to interact with PSQL. These APIs can be found through my Github link <a href="https://github.com/Dong93-dev/be-nc-news">https://github.com/Dong93-dev/be-nc-news</a>. Moreover, the JWT auth was integrated to provide secure access to these APIs. The frontend was developed using React and a little Bootstrap. Feel free to check out my frontend source code <a href="https://github.com/Dong93-dev/dong-nc-news-app">https://github.com/Dong93-dev/dong-nc-news-app</a>. The project took about two weeks to complete but I still put many efforts on improvement of UI/UX. Some details were considered, such as optimistic rendering to update the vote number, localStorage to keep the comment in case of accident refreshing, and etc.</p>

          <p>A big surprise for those who are using express and knex. This command-line generator was created to boost the productivity of express backend development and knex interaction with SQL. This generator was fully tested and has potential to be expanded to cover other backend framework in the future.</p>
